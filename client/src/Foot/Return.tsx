      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-5">
        <strong>Harmaig Cash:</strong> You can choose to have the refund sent to your original payment method or bank account.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-5">
        <strong>Harmaig Gold Wallet:</strong> You can use this credit for future purchases, but the amount cannot be refunded in cash.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-5">Select the item you wish to return from your order.</p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-5">
        <li className="mb-4">Pack the jewellery in its original packaging along with any certification.</li>
        <li className="mb-4">If the product is valued under INR 35,000, simply hand it over to the pickup personnel.</li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          For products valued above INR 35,000:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
            <li className="mb-2">If a Harmaig employee picks up the item, hand it over directly.</li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              If a third-party logistics partner handles the pickup, you'll receive a tamper-proof packet from us. Secure and seal your jewellery in it before handing it over. Once sealed, the packet cannot be opened without destroying it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">Collect a receipt or confirmation of the pickup (e.g., paper receipt, tracking photo, SMS confirmation).</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-5">
        Once we receive the product at our facility and complete a quality check, your refund will be processed within 2-3 working days to your Harmaig account.
